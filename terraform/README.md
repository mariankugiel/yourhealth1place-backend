## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **AWS CLI** configured with appropriate credentials
2. **Terraform** >= 1.0 installed
3. **AWS S3 bucket** for Terraform state (create manually)

### Multi-Environment Setup

This infrastructure supports three environments: **dev**, **stage**, and **prod**. Each environment has its own configuration and state file.

#### Using Deployment Scripts (Recommended)

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
# Deploy to development environment
./deploy.sh dev plan
./deploy.sh dev apply

# Deploy to staging environment
./deploy.sh stage plan
./deploy.sh stage apply

# Deploy to production environment
./deploy.sh prod plan
./deploy.sh prod apply
```

**Windows:**
```cmd
# Deploy to development environment
deploy.bat dev plan
deploy.bat dev apply

# Deploy to staging environment
deploy.bat stage plan
deploy.bat stage apply

# Deploy to production environment
deploy.bat prod plan
deploy.bat prod apply
```

#### Manual Setup

1. **Create S3 bucket for Terraform state:**
   ```bash
   aws s3 mb s3://yourhealth1place-terraform-state
   aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket yourhealth1place-terraform-state --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled
   ```

2. **Initialize Terraform for specific environment:**
   ```bash
   cd terraform
   terraform init -backend-config="key=dev/terraform.tfstate"
   ```

3. **Review the plan:**
   ```bash
   terraform plan -var-file="environments/dev.tfvars"
   ```

4. **Apply the configuration:**
   ```bash
   terraform apply -var-file="environments/dev.tfvars"
   ```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Management

The infrastructure supports three environments with separate configurations:

- **Development (`environments/dev.tfvars`)**: Minimal resources for cost optimization
- **Staging (`environments/stage.tfvars`)**: Mirror of production for testing
- **Production (`environments/prod.tfvars`)**: Full production configuration

### Environment Variables

Each environment has its own configuration file. Example for development:

```hcl
# Development Environment Configuration
environment = "dev"
project_name = "YourHealth1Place"

# VPC Configuration
vpc_cidr = "10.0.0.0/16"
availability_zones = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b"]
private_subnets = ["10.0.1.0/24", "10.0.2.0/24"]
public_subnets = ["10.0.101.0/24", "10.0.102.0/24"]

# S3 Bucket Names (will be prefixed with environment)
health_data_bucket_name = "health-data"
logs_bucket_name = "logs"
backup_bucket_name = "backup"

# Athena Configuration
athena_database_name = "healthcare_analytics_dev"
athena_workgroup_name = "healthcare_workgroup_dev"

# SNS Configuration
notification_email = "dev-admin@yourhealth1place.com"
```

### Important Notes

- **Bucket Names**: S3 bucket names are automatically prefixed with environment (e.g., `dev-health-data`)
- **Email**: Each environment has its own notification email
- **State Files**: Each environment has its own Terraform state file
- **Resource Isolation**: Complete isolation between environments

## üîÑ Deployment Workflow

### Environment-Specific Deployment

**Development Environment:**
```bash

./deploy.sh dev plan

# Apply deployment
./deploy.sh dev apply
```

**Staging Environment:**
```bash
# Plan deployment
./deploy.sh stage plan

# Apply deployment
./deploy.sh stage apply
```

**Production Environment:**
```bash
# Plan deployment
./deploy.sh prod plan

# Apply deployment
./deploy.sh prod apply
```

### Manual Deployment (Alternative)

```bash
# Initialize for specific environment
terraform init -backend-config="key=dev/terraform.tfstate"

# Plan with environment-specific variables
terraform plan -var-file="environments/dev.tfvars"

# Apply with environment-specific variables
terraform apply -var-file="environments/dev.tfvars"
```

## üßπ Cleanup

### Destroy Specific Environment

**Using deployment scripts:**
```bash
# Destroy development environment
./deploy.sh dev destroy

# Destroy staging environment
./deploy.sh stage destroy

# Destroy production environment
./deploy.sh prod destroy
```

**Manual commands:**
```bash
# Destroy development environment
terraform destroy -var-file="environments/dev.tfvars"

# Destroy staging environment
terraform destroy -var-file="environments/stage.tfvars"

# Destroy production environment
terraform destroy -var-file="environments/prod.tfvars"
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: This will permanently delete all resources and data in the specified environment.

### Environment Management

For detailed information about managing multiple environments, see [ENVIRONMENT_MANAGEMENT.md](ENVIRONMENT_MANAGEMENT.md).

## üìã Outputs

After deployment, Terraform will output:

- VPC and subnet information
- S3 bucket names and ARNs
- IAM role ARNs
- Athena database and workgroup names
- SNS topic ARNs
- KMS key ARNs
- CloudWatch log group names

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **S3 Bucket Name Already Exists**
   - Update bucket names in `terraform.tfvars`
   - Ensure names are globally unique

2. **IAM Role Already Exists**
   - Update project name in `terraform.tfvars`
   - Or delete existing roles manually

3. **VPC CIDR Conflict**
   - Update `vpc_cidr` in `terraform.tfvars`
   - Choose a different CIDR range

### Support

For issues with this infrastructure:

1. Check CloudWatch logs for application errors
2. Review SNS notifications for alerts
3. Verify IAM permissions are correct
4. Ensure all required variables are set
